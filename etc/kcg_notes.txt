Tools used: valgrind --tool=callgrind main, then KCacheGrind app

Uni:
* run() >40%, eval_density() <30%, cluster_estimate() 30% -> evenly distributed
* As for run(), almost all time spent in step() (-> collecting is irrelevant),
  with sample_allocations() being the main component at almost 40%
* like() takes a total of >30% and 6M calls across run() and eval_density()
  times
* cluster_estimate() time is split across several basic Eigen operations

Multi:
* run() 58%, eval_density() 40% -> cluster_estimate() has become irrelevant
* As for run(), same as univar case
* eval_marg() >50%, called 133k times, presumably due to matrix inversion and
  Student's t evaluation, both of which require expensive Cholesky
  decompositions
* like() has become only 17% despite being called 189k times, more than
  eval_marg()
* since estimate algorithms have not changed, this means like() is optimized
  enough for it to withstand the jump to the multidim case better than the
  other functions
