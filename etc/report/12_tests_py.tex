\chapter{Python tests}
We implemented 8 tests in Python using data coming from different distributions and mixtures to assess the predicting power of the estimates of the library.
All 8 of them were run with the following settings:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \verb|Neal2| algorithm with 500 iterations, of which 100 for the burn-in phase
	\item Dirichlet process with total mass $m=1$
	\item NNIG hierarchy for the univariate tests and the NNW hierarchy for the multivariate ones
	\item Hyperparameters for all NNIG hierarchies: $\mu_0 = 0.0$, $\lambda = 0.1$, $\alpha = 2$, $\beta = 2$
	\item Hyperparameters for all $d$-dimensional NNW hierarchies: $\mu_0$ is the sample mean of the data, $\lambda = 0.2$, $\nu = d + 3$, $\tau_0 = \frac{1}{\nu} I_d$ (multiple of identity matrix).
\end{itemize}
Data were iid generated through the use of an R script.
Below are listed the first 4 univariate tests alongside their respective sample size and the process from which the data was produced:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{r|r|l}
		test & $n$ & process \\ \hline
		1 &  200 & $y \sim 0.5 \, \Nc(-3, 1) + 0.5 \, \Nc(3, 1)$ \\
		2 & 1000 & $y \sim 0.9 \, \Nc(-5, 1) + 0.1 \, \Nc(5, 1)$ \\
		3 &  200 & $y \sim 0.3 \, \Nc(-2, 0.8^2) + 0.3 \, \Nc(0, 0.8^2) + 0.4 \, \Nc(2, 1)$ \\
		4 &  400 & $y \sim 0.5 \, t(5, -5, 1 ) + 0.5 \, SkewNormal(2, -5, 1)$
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The Skew Normal TODO \\
Tests 5 through 8 use multivariate data of increasing dimension $d = 2,5,10,20$; the sample size for each of them is $n=400$ and is generated from
$$y \sim 0.5 \, \Nc(-3 \cdot 1_d, I_d) + 0.5 \, \Nc(3 \cdot 1_d, I_d)$$
where $1_d$ is the $d$-dimensional unit vector and $I_d$ the $d$-dimensional identity matrix. \\
