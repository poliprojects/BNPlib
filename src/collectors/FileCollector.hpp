//! Class for a collector that writes its content to a file.

//! This is a type of collector that writes each state passed to it to a binary
//! file. Unlike the memory collector, the contents of this collector are perma-
//! nent, because every state collected by it remains ever after the termination
//! of the main that created it, in Protobuf form, in the corresponding file.
//! This approach is mandatory, for instance, if different main programs are
//! used both to run the algorithm and the estimates. Therefore, a file collec-
//! tor has both a reading and a writing mode.

class FileCollector: public BaseCollector {
protected:
    //! Unix file descriptor for reading mode
    int infd;
    //! Unix file descriptor for writing mode
    int outfd;
    //! Pointer to a reading file stream
    google::protobuf::io::FileInputStream *fin;
    //! Pointer to a writing file stream
    google::protobuf::io::FileOutputStream *fout;
    //! Name of file from which read/write
    std::string filename;
