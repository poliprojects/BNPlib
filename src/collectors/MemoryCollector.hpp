//! Class for a "virtual" collector which contains all objects of the chain

//! This is a type of collector which includes a deque containing all states of
//! the chain. Unlike the file collector, this is a purely "virtual" collector,
//! in the sense that it does not write chain states anywhere and all
//! information contained in it is destroyed when the main that created it is
//! terminated. It is therefore useful in situation in which writing to a file
//! is not needed, for instance in a main program that both runes and algorithm
//! and computes the estimates.

class MemoryCollector: public BaseCollector {
protected:
    //! Deque that contains all states in Protobuf-object form
    std::deque<State> chain;

    //! Reads the next state, based on the curr_iter curson
    State next_state() override;

    // DESTRUCTOR AND CONSTRUCTORS

    //! Initializes collector (here, it does nothing)
    void start() override {return;}
    //! Closes collector (here, it does nothing)
    void finish() override {return;}

    //! Writes the given state to the collector
    void collect(State iter_state) override;

    // GETTERS AND SETTERS
    //! Returns i-th state in the collector
    State get_state(unsigned int i) override {return chain[i];}
    //! Returns the whole chain in form of a deque of States
    std::deque<State> get_chain() override {return chain;}
