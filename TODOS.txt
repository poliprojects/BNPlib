TODO LIST

FEATURES/IMPLEMENTATION
* blocked Gibbs?
* Mixture base? (Dirichlet, PitYor derived)
* one method for prob_existing_cluster / prob_new_cluster ?
* probas in a separate function?
* store card vector somewhere?
* what to do with DEBUG lines?
* !!! deal with the extra dynamically allocated Hypers
* constructors (arguments)
* Hypers not fixed
* a way to erase and add clusters more efficiently?
* check, in write_clust_...(), if clust_estimate() has been called, and similar
  flags
* aggiungere step sample_weights/sample_hyper return 0 o enable_if /
   type_dispatch? sample_weights : classe template?
* stan con quale rng??



MANOVALANZA
* print specifics/results of running algorithm/initial message/ending message
* documentation with Doxygen
* complete README
* print functions: remove last empty column
* rename proto messages
* unsigned int -> size_t in for loops
* data -> Eigen vector/matrix


MAIL MARIO
* Are sample_unique_values() and initialize() common to ALL algorithms?
* COLLECTORS

OTHER CHE NON FAREMO
* acceleration steps
