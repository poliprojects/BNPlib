TODO LIST
URGENT
* README.md for the Github repo
* "log"-like?
* Neal2::sample_allocations() does not use eval_marg?
* print() -> print_state()

REPORT (URGENT)
* TODOS in the report!!!!!
* Check references
* Results:
** "la prior nconta ncazz" (sic)
** if the two means are too close, the density estimate mistakens them as only
   one gaussian
** varying M (total mass)
** varying m (auxiliary blocks)
** Neal8 vs Neal2: similar results (b/c they both converged?)
** unique values do not matter for allocation (and best allocation)

OTHER
* constructors (arguments)
* probas in a separate function?
* deal with the extra dynamically allocated Hypers
* a way to erase and add clusters more efficiently
* rename proto messages
* blocked Gibbs?
* all TODOS in the files
* create generic Algorithm class
* acceleration steps?
* Hypers not fixed

MANOVALANZA
* DEBUG lines
* print specifics/results of running algorithm
* documentation with Doxygen
