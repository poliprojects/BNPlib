MOST IMPORTANT
* save_to_csv()
* cluster_estimate()
* density_estimate()
* Report + slides

TODO LIST
* is the posterior update given data, given clusters, correct?
* a way to erase and add clusters more efficiently
* Documentation with Doxygen (?)
* readme.md mide for the Github repo
* probas in a separate function?
* initialize() with boost::random::mt19937 (or boost::mt19937?)
* deal with the extra dynamically allocated Hypers
* empty includes.hpp as much as possible
* acceleration steps?
* density_eval: proto and csv
* write chain to file?

STYLE
* DEBUG
* if {}
* indentation
* remove libraries and includes
* const everywhere
* order of methods (publ-prot-publ...)
* remove typedefs

SLIDES
* Add PDF about the integral in the references
